# Intrinsic-plagiarism-Detection
Academic project - A tool to detect plagiarism using intrinsic methodology where no external artifacts are required.


## Abstract
As the research in various fields is increasing many-fold these days,
there are a lot of research papers published online for reference. Many
aspects of research topics overlap and often the data in the newer
research papers appear similar to some source of information already
published in a format thatâ€Ÿs not available digitally. This leads to
plagiarism in research papers. Such sections of data in research papers
are difficult to find out, especially when there is no reference corpus
available digitally. The Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection software attempts
to detect plagiarised sections in newly published research papers using
intrinsic mode of plagiarism detection without using a reference corpus
based on grammar analysis of the sentences written by the author in the
research papers. Thus, the suspicious sentences are found by computing
the similarity distance between grammar trees and by utilizing a
Gaussian normal distribution.
